<h1>Sanwich Burgertale</h1>
<p>
<br>
So this game is just a single boss fight on like a 35 second attack pattern loop. There was supposed to be a story mode but clearly I didn't finish it yet.
<br>
There's music so turn up the volume. I wrote and played it myself. You can hear my fingers hitting the keyboard and where the audio cuts among other issues. 
<br>
(I had to edit the parts that I got right together because I never managed to play it all in one take lol.)   
<br>
Anyways. There was an attempt.
<br>
Arrow Keys = Shoot (hold multiple for diagonal)
<br>
WASD = Movement
<br>
Spacebar = Special
<br>
Shoot at Sanwich until he dies. (He may or may not be mad at you for killing everyone.)
<br>
Don't reload the page if you die, instead hit the back button and then the fight button again, it breaks otherwise, don't ask me why.
<br>
The fight begins as soon as you click the button that says "fight". GLHF
